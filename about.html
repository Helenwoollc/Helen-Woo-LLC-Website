								<h2>About</h2>
								<p>Nearly 40 years ago, Dr. John and Helen Woo started their rental property business to provide affordable housing for residents in Pullman, Washington.<br> John was a plant pathologist at the University of Idaho while Helen operated a sprout business which served local businesses including WSU. John was an accomplished carpenter and enjoyed building and repairing things which came in handy with the rentals. After John passed away in 1995, Helen continued to run the rental business until she passed away in 2016.  
								<br>Their four children, including two WSU alumnae, continue their parent's legacy to provide housing to a countless number of accomplished WSU undergraduate and graduate students and professionals.<br>
								
								As a family run business, we strive to treat each resident with integrity and respect and respond promptly to any concerns with the help of our dedicated property manager, Bill Hotchkin, a WSU alumnus.
								<br>As Butch's Approved Cougar Choice Housing, we are committed to keeping our residents in a safe, and peaceful, living environment.
								<br>
								We would love the opportunity to serve you.</p>
